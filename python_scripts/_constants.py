    """Jesus and Satan have an argument as to who is the better programmer.  This goes on for a few hours until they come to an agreement to hold a contest with God as the judge.  They set themselves before their computers and begin.  They type furiously, lines of code streaming up the screen, for several hours straight.
Seconds before the end of the competition, a bolt of lightning strikes, taking out the electricity.  Moments later, the power is restored, and God announces that the contest is over.  He asks Satan to show his work.  Visibly upset, Satan cries and says, I have nothing.  I lost it all when the power went out.
Very well, says God, let us see if Jesus has fared any better. Jesus presses a key, and the screen comes to life in vivid display, the voices of an angelic choir pour forth from the speakers. Satan is astonished.  He stutters, B-b-but how?!  I lost everything, yet Jesus program is intact!  How did he do it?
God chuckles, Everybody knows… Jesus saves.

A programmer finds himself in front of a committee that decides whether he should go to Heaven or Hell.  The committee tells the programmer he has a say in the matter and asks him if he wants to see either Heaven or Hell before stating his preference.
Sure, the programmer replies.  I have a pretty good idea what Heaven is like, so lets see Hell.  So an angel takes the programmer to a sunny beach, full of beautiful women in skimpy bikinis playing volleyball, listening to music and having a great time.  Wow! he exclaims, Hell looks great!  Ill take Hell!
Instantly the programmer finds himself in red-hot lava with demons tearing at his flesh.  Wheres the beach?  The music?  The women? he screams frantically to the angel. That was the demo, the angel replies as she vanishes.

A computer science student is studying under a tree and another pulls up on a flashy new bike.  The first student asks, Where did you get that? The student on the bike replies, While I was studying outside, a beautiful girl pulled up on her bike.  She took off all her clothes and said, You can have anything you want.
The first student responds, Good choice!  Her clothes probably wouldn't have fit you.
